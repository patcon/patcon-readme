# Collaborator README: patcon

A personal README, written for the benefit of potential collaborators, sharing how I tend to work and think.

This is an evolving document, intended as a demo for fellow worker-owners at [Hypha Worker Co-operative](https://hypha.coop).

## Brainstorm

- I have a bias toward leaving options open.
- I am comfortable with uncertainty, and often favour letting messiness exist before defining something. Sometimes I'd prefer not to overly define it, even if it seems well-understood.
- I am process-oriented.
- I prefer to blame process before people.
- I am often biased toward conversation and discussion, and execution can be delayed.
- I try to define and document process only to the extent as to lock in things that have been discovered to work in practice. I prefer not to document or define in anticipation of something not yet proven or exercised.
- I believe we learn about things that flow. I prefer not to lock down aspects that I still feel the collective is learning about.
- I can be stubborn.
- I believe in expressing gratitude early and often.
- Cultures of gratitude are important to me.
- At present, I am most proud of how I work in shared physical space with people, as touch-points with others act as accountability structures for me.
- I am biased toward research and mapping landscapes, and can sometimes air on the side of too much mapping before initiating action.
